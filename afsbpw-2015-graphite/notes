Title: Large Scale OpenAFS performance monitoring with Graphite
Date: August 20, 2015

Outline

1. High level description of graphite
  a) Background and Architecture
  b)


2. Feeding OpenAFS metrics to graphite
  a) OpenAFS stat data gathering
  b) The metric namespace tree
  c) types of metrics: counters, gauges, etc
  d) carbon configuraion

3. Examples


Important points

(in no particular order)
* open source, widely used
* graphite scales via clustering
* loads of tools that work with graphite, e.g. grafana

metrics
* easy to feed data
* show types of afs metrics
* hierachy of metrics, metric paths

carbon config
* data collection interval should match retention config!
* the aggregation method needs to match the data type

whisper
* cmd line tools to dump raw data

graphite
* web rest api for rendering
* functions!

afs specifics....
