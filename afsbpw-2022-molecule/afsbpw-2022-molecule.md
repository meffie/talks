Abstract:

In this talk we demonstrate how to use Ansible Molecule to easily create
OpenAFS development and testing environments on one or more local or cloud
hosted virtual machines. Prebuilt OpenAFS packages can be installed or OpenAFS
can be installed from source to create clients, fileservers, and databases on
various platforms. A Kerberos realm can also be automatically created for
development and testing.

Molecule provides support for testing with multiple instances, operating
systems and distributions, virtualization providers, test frameworks and
testing scenarios.
