Introduction to Python workshop.

This will be a series of hands-on assignments for the students to learn the
basics of python. To try to make things interesting, we will write a program to
get data from the US census using the web rest api.  A free developer key is
required. It is sent to a valid email address. (I have one, but sharing it
would probably be against the TOS.)

See:

Example API Request:

    # List population by state
    wget -O - "http://api.census.gov/data/2010/sf1?key=${KEY}&get=P0010001,NAME&for=state:*"


    # List population and housing vacant
    wget -o /dev/null -O - "http://api.census.gov/data/2010/sf1?key=${KEY}&get=P0010001,H0030003,NAME&for=state:*"
