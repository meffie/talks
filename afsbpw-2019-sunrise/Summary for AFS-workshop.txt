Business View of the AFS Service

Official Company-name changed to Sunrise (fictitious)
Business View of the AFS Service
There is a series of Linux/Unix based services which are vital to Sunrise’s
development and test at several sites on 3 continents around the globe.
• These services include Linux and Unix managed workplaces, Terminal Servers,
Global Application delivery and other services which are dependent on AFS. All
are orderable products supported by contractual agreements.
• There is a good reason that many people are not aware of the AFS service we
provide to Sunrise. The AFS file system provides a transparent mechanism to
supply the application tree, environment files, ARC project environments and
toolboxes to Sunrise's Linux/Unix services such as managed workplaces around
the world.
• There are 2 major areas of AFS seen from Managed Workplace clients at
Sunrise.
• /app -> Applications /afs/CELL/app/… Application distribution for
workplaces (Solaris, Linux-RedHat/SuSe/Ubunto) and Toolboxes.
• /env -> SITE FILES, LICENCES and ARC /afs/Cell/env/… The /env directory
contains several important types of files used by Sunrise:
1. Site crontabs: /env/$SITE/lmw/cron
2. Site licenses: /env/$SITE/licenses
3. Ericsson ARC Project: /env/PROJECT (Info: The Application Release
Center, also known as ARC is a project to get a common, highly flexible
and configurable UNIX environment.)

History

AFS at Sunrise was introduced ~1999 in Sweden locally at one site. A few years
later more sites were added. In 2006 AFS replication limit (11 RO-volumes) was
reached and 4 'AFS-SUB-CELLs' were created. These SUB-Cells have a special copy
from each volume that is needed with a region-code (TAG-Volume). Disadvantages:
- Still one Cell with only 3 AFSDB-servers worldwide - Change of mount points
required in TAG-volumes (Via dumpscan) - Double storage capacity needed on TAG
RW-servers

In 2015 SNA was engaged to create a product to support multi-sync for different
Cells -> CellCC CellCC is now used to sync 1 source-cell to 4 other cells on 3
continents.
At Sunrise we have seen performance problems with AFS releases (UDP-based)
when it comes to WAN traffic. Therefore we have implement a new mechanism
developed by SNA: DPF for releases (TCP-based) This is now active since several
month as default for releases. Improvement factor: 5 - 15 times faster depending
on network topology

Statistics:

5 active AFS-Cells: 1 source + 4 x Target cells
